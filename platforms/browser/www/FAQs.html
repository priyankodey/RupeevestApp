                                                <p class="faq_2">FATCA is aimed at ensuring that US persons with financial assets outside of the US pay US tax. It is a new piece of legislation to help counter tax evasion in the US.</p>
                                                <p class="faq_2">The purpose of FATCA is to prevent US persons from using banks and other financial institutions outside the US to park their wealth outside US and avoid US taxation on income generated from such wealth. FATCA obliges such banks and financial institutions to report information about US persons having accounts with them.</p>

                                                <p>At RupeeVest, we use a definition of classifying stocks by market capitalization which we believe is dynamic and self-adjusting. We classify large caps as the smallest number of stocks which make up 70% of the total universe market capitalization. It normally stands around 75-100 stocks. Mid-caps are defined as the smallest number of stocks which make up the next 20% of the market capitalization of the universe. It normally stands around 200-250 stocks. Remaining number of stocks are classified as small caps which contribute the remaining 10% of the universe market capitalization. We take last 6 months average market capitalization for calculation purpose.</p>

                                                <p>To summarize:</p>
                                                <p>Large Caps = Smallest number of stocks equaling 70% of total market capitalization</p>
                                                <p>Mid-Caps = Next smallest number of stocks equaling 20% of total market capitalization</p>
                                                <p>Small Caps = Remaining number of stocks equaling 10% of total market capitalization</p>

                                                <p>This method of classification is not affected by the overall market movement as the funds are classified relative to each other. However, as individual funds rise or decline more than the rest of the market, they may move from one category to another over a period of time. Using this classification, the funds are allocated to categories which best reflect their characteristics which is essential for comparison and rating.</p>

                                                <p>Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is deducted if the interest earned on a corporate fixed deposit exceeds Rs. 5,000 in a financial year. If total income from all sources is under permissible non-taxable income levels then, individuals below 65 years should file form 15G and individuals above 65 years should file form 15H. However, individuals whose income from other sources exceeds INR 1 lakh cannot file a 15G form. If no form is filed and the income from Corporate FDs is more than 5000 then the corporate will deduct a 10 % plus 3 % education cess, therefore a total 10.3 % of the interest earned.</p>

                                                <p>Yes, corporate FDs can be pre-matured, but usually most of them levy a penalty for the same. However, we request you to look at individual company offer documents for the terms of pre-maturing their deposits as this may vary.</p>

Senior citizens in most cases are given a higher rate of return in most corporate FDs. Some companies offer a higher rate of return to women, widows, armed force personnel, its employees, and its various customers (Home Loan/ SME Loan/ Mortgage Loan). Please check the various offerings by different companies and their special categories before finalizing your FD purchase.</p>
